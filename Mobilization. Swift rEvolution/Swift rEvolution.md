# Why Swift is revolution?
<br>

1. *__OPEN__* language
2. Learning & Teaching & Coding  
3. Tools and Platforms
4. Community - People. 👨, 👩 

^ - My first programing language was Pascal, 
- Tried teach wife C++

--- 

# Open 🔓

1. Source code at GitHub
2. Full commit history ~~43,429~~ **43,466 commits** 
3. Commit access
3. New open source projects: swift-protobuf
4. Workflow
5. Evolution and discussions

^ full commit history - That's really a courage
37 commits
Workflow: Jira bugs.swift.org 
Roy talk about objc runtime. How many of you have used objc-runtime opensource

#[fit] Great as first programming language!

^
- we take for granted other parts 
- Swift is simple and powerful. You can learn basics of programming in swift and write powerful app using same language.
- Perfect as first language to learn
- iPad playgrounds, teaching kids coding
- Easy for developers to read the code 

---

# **Tools** 🛠

- Swift compiler + stdlib 
- foundation, libdispatch 
- xctest
- Swift Package Manager, llbuild
- CI, 🤖, Benchmark
- **More**:    playgrounds, protobuf
